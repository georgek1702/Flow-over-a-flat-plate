# flatPlateSkinFriction
A laminar flow over a flat plate is numerically solved in this code.
The continuity and Navier stokes eqautions are solved on a flat plate.
These equations are discretized and solved in the code.
Boundary conditons are applied and a shooting method is used to satisfy the boundary conditions.
After solving the code, we obtain the constant of skin friction for laminar flow, boundary layer profile, velocity profile in the boundary layer etc.

FURTHER STUDY
The effect of different material properties, flow conditoins etc. on the velocity profile and boundary layer can be studied.
